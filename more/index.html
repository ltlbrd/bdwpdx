                  <p>I am a Portland-raised artist and designer who grew up dreaming of being a riot-grrl-art-witch with a kitchen garden. Most of that has come true to degrees, though the majority of my spells these days are broth-based.
                    I gather my inpsiration from the natural world of the Pacific Northwest, macro images of fungi, storytellers, street artists, music-makers and my experiences traveling near and far.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    My enjoyment of building unique websites started back in 1996 when I first taught myself how to hand code pages in HTML. For more than twenty years, I was just a hobbyist while pursuing careers in the outdoors and tourism. A hard-won fight against an unusual bone marrow cancer derailed those notions for me, and I spent the first four years of my remission trying to get back the slice of physical vigor I had lost. One day, as the five-year mark of being cancer-free started to peak above the horizon, I realized I had never lost my love of coding or my passion for design and began a dedicated path of study and delightful, hard work.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Today, I enjoy helping my clients curate their design projects and build individualized branding. When I'm not at the computer, you can find me exploring the outdoors by land and water; cooking healthful, delicious meals; and making art in the physical realm.
